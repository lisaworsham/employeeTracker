# employeeTracker

The purpose of this web application is to create an Employee Database where the user can access the database to view departments, roles and employees; add departments, roles and employees; and update an existing employee.

## Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code was used to build. NodeJS, inquirer and MySQL are needed to run. Input the schema and seeds into MySQL and update the password info on line 18. In the terminal, user will need to do a **NPM install** to ensure commands will run. Then input **node server.js** to run the application.

## Process/What was Changed

All of this had to be built from the ground up. I first started with the database in MySQL. There needed to be three tables: department, roles, and employees. Then I needed to input some existing information to showcase my data. I moved on to the code starting what needed to be done with the program. So I made a switch/case function to allow the user to choose what they wanted to do. Then I created the functions for each choice. 

## Review

It was interesting getting to know MySQL. I personally love information and data in general. However, I'm still not fully comfortable on how to manipulate that data. This is something I will need to practice and experiment with more. I'm going to try and Delete feature and seeing about adding up the department budgets since I feel that will help me in journey.
